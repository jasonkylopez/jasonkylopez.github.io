# Undergraduate Researcher - Mechanical Design
**Additive Manufacturing and Metamaterials Laboratory (AMML)**  
**UC Berkeley** | *May 2024 â€“ December 2024*

## Overview  
During my time at the **Additive Manufacturing and Metamaterials Laboratory (AMML)**, I focused on advancing additive manufacturing by designing an innovative **DLP multi-material 3D printer** that utilized **dual projection** to cure resins at two different wavelengths. This printer was instrumental in testing various resin formulas and mixtures to identify the optimal combination for the development of **electroless copper plating** on intricate resin prints. Its ability to print multiple microlattices simultaneously highlighted its efficiency and potential for producing complex multi-material prints. 

## Key Contributions  
My main responsibilities included using **SolidWorks** to design the entire assembly of the printer and oversee its fabrication. I conceptualized and prototyped modular vats, printheads, mounts, and other interchangeable components to ensure ease of use and adaptability. With access to several commercial 3D printers in our lab, I was able to test various CAD models extensively. This project also enhanced my skills in testing for tolerances and designing parts that were both easy to assemble and structurally robust.

## Dual-Wavelength 3D Printing
Current methods for electroless copper plating on 3D-printed components necessitate material change, which includes cleaning processes as well, between vats between each layer resulting in a very time consuming process. Our new novel approach employs two distinct types of polymerization (ring opening polymerization and free radical polymerization), each controlled by a different wavelength. Consequently, this method eliminates the need for material change processes, significantly enhancing the overall print speed. The following image displays the overview of how our printer works:
