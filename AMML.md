# Undergraduate Researcher  
**Additive Manufacturing and Metamaterials Lab (AMML)**  
**UC Berkeley** | *May 2023 â€“ December 2024*

## Overview  
As an undergraduate researcher, I focused on advancing **multimaterial Digital Light Processing (DLP) 3D printing** and the development of **piezoelectric actuators**. My work involved designing 3D printers and their software, manufacturing small scale piezoelectric actuators, and optimizing printing parameters of novel printing techniques.

## Key Contributions  

### Multimaterial DLP Printing
I designed and fabicated a DLP printer that incorporated a new cleaning method between resin swaps. I also configured the software for material swapping and cleaning through **Arduino** and **LabVIEW**. Produced successful multimaterial prints with minimized resin cross-contamination.
