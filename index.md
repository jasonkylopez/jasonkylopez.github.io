About Me
----
Hello! My name is **Jason Lopez**, and I am a **Mechanical Engineer** with a passion for mechanical design and creating innovative solutions for robotics and electronics.

In December 2024, I graduated from the **University of California, Berkeley**, with a Bachelor’s degree in **Mechanical Engineering**, achieving a **GPA of 3.54**. During my academic journey, I had the privilege of gaining hands-on experience at the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)](https://www.lbl.gov/) and the [Additive Manufacturing and Metamaterials Lab (AMML)](https://www.raynexzheng.com/). I currently work as a mechanical engineer at a metal fabrication shop in San Pedro, CA called **Fierro Fab**. There, I tackle the arduous task of restoring a very sought after classic car model, a **1965 Lincoln Continental**.

Beyond school and work, I enjoy spending my time rock climbing, playing soccer, learning guitar, exploring nature, 3D printing, and working on personal projects.
