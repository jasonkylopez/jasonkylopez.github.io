Who I Am
----
In December 2024, I graduated from the **University of California, Berkeley**, with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in **Mechanical Engineering**, achieving a **GPA of 3.54**. During my academic journey, I had the privilege of gaining hands-on experience at the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)](https://www.lbl.gov/) and the [Additive Manufacturing and Metamaterials Lab (AMML)](https://www.raynexzheng.com/). These opportunities, combined with the rigorous education I received at an institution like UC Berkeley, have shaped me into a well-rounded engineer equipped with the skills, knowledge, and determination to excel in the industry.

Beyond school and work, I enjoy spending my time rock climbing, playing soccer, learning guitar, exploring nature, 3D printing, and working on personal projects.
