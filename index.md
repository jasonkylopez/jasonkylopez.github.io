Hello! My name is Jason Lopez, and I am a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for designing and creating innovative solutions for robotics and electronics.

(IMAGE OF FACE HERE)

In December 2024, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering, achieving a GPA of 3.54. During my academic journey, I had the privilege of gaining hands-on experience at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and the Additive Manufacturing and Metamaterials Lab (AMML). These opportunities, combined with the rigorous education I received at an institution like UC Berkeley, have shaped me into a well-rounded engineer equipped with the skills, knowledge, and determination to excel in the industry.

Beyond school and work, I enjoy spending my time rock climbing, playing soccer, learning guitar, going to the beach, thrifting, 3D printing, and working on personal projects.
