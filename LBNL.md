# Undergraduate Researcher - Instrumentation and Measurements
**Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (AMML)**  
**UC Berkeley** | *May 2023 – August 2023*

## Overview  
In the Summer of 2023 I was given the opportunity to work at one of Berkeley’s most prestigious laboratories, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The Optics sector of the lab was planning on fabricating another microchip printer (MET5) for the lab and I was given the task of measuring the vibrations and resonant ground frequencies in the area to get key information for the engineering team. Knowing these frequencies is imperative in the process of  mitigating any sort of vibrations that would cause imprecisions with printing something as small as a new microchip. This is especially true considering the sector was beside the Advanced Light Source, LBNL’s particle accelerator, as well as a lot of foot traffic in the area.
