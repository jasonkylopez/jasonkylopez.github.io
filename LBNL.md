# Undergraduate Researcher - Instrumentation and Measurements
**Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)**  
**UC Berkeley** | *May 2023 – August 2023*

## Overview  
During the summer of 2023, I had the privilege of working at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), one of Berkeley’s most prestigious research facilities. As part of the Optics Sector’s initiative to identify a suitable location for a new microchip printer, I was tasked with measuring vibrations and resonant ground frequencies in the proposed area. Collecting this data was critical for the engineering team, as understanding these frequencies is essential to mitigating vibrations that could compromise the precision required for microchip fabrication. This challenge was particularly significant given the sector’s proximity to the Advanced Light Source (LBNL’s particle accelerator), a nearby machine shop, and a high-foot-traffic area, all of which posed potential sources of interference.

## Key Contributions 
To measure ground motion within the lab sector, I utilized seismic accelerometers connected to a data acquisition system. This setup allowed me to capture and analyze vibration frequencies accurately. Additionally, I became proficient in using DataPhysics software, which played a critical role in collecting data from the sensors, organizing it into files, and enabling further analysis and configuration. Using MATLAB, I processed the collected data by applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms to analyze the frequency spectra. This allowed me to visualize and interpret the data in a meaningful way, providing the engineering team with insights to effectively dampen and mitigate the unwanted vibrations.
