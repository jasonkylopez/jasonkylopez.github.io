# Mechanical Engineer
**San Pedro, CA** | *April 2025 – {Present}*

## Overview  
As a Mechanical Engineer at Fierro Fab, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting restoration project involving several 1965 Lincoln Continentals. As the company is in the early stages of being a startup, I was deeply involved in a wide range of projects and collaborated closely with fabricators, designers, and engineers from diverse backgrounds.

Main Resposibilities: 
1. Designed and built custom dies, fixtures, and bucks to support the forming and restoration of sheet metal components. 
2. Utilized 3D scanning software and equipment to reverse engineer and redesign automotive parts for repair and reproduction. 
3. Surface modeled different car panels and parts using referenced scanned mesh data in Autodesk Fusion and QuickSurface.
4. Operated and managed 3D printers and laser cutters to produce and refine prototypes for various mechanical parts. 
5. Checked clearances for newly added components and structural modifications, and recommended design changes when needed.

### Fender and Body Panel Restorations:

## Problem: 
Rust had degraded every body panel due to rain and humidity, requiring restoration for a finished appearance. Most body panels featured complex geometries, and the restoration called for repeatability across multiple Lincolns as well as mirrored driver and passenger side components.

## Goal: 
Design bucks and dies for the fabricators to speed up and refine the process of metal working.

## Role: 
My role encompassed the end to end design of jigs, bucks, and dies used by fabricators for metal restoration. This process involved 3D scanning the vehicle body to capture mesh data, using that data as a reference to surface model the body panels back to their original formed state, and designing the corresponding bucks, jigs, or dies from the finalized surface profile. These tools were then 3D printed for use in fabrication.

## Results:  
These 3D printed custom tools streamlined the fabrication process by removing the need for manually prepared profiles and cutout templates, enabling fabricators to achieve finished parts more quickly and with more accuracy as well.
