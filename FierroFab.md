# Fierro Fab - Mechanical Engineer I
**San Pedro, CA** | *April 2025 – {Present}*

---

## Overview  
As a Mechanical Engineer at Fierro Fab, I've had the opportunity of working on an exciting restoration project involving several 
1965 Lincoln Continentals as well as some side work with a 1968 Camaro. My work at Fierro Fab bridges physical fabrication and digital design, enabling higher accuracy, repeatability, and reduced fabrication time. As the company is in its early stages of being a startup, I am deeply involved in a wide range of 
projects and collaborated closely with fabricators, designers, and engineers from diverse backgrounds. 

## Main Resposibilities: 
1. Designed and built custom **dies, fixtures, and bucks** to support the forming and restoration of sheet metal components. 
2. Utilized **3D scanning software and equipment** to reverse engineer and redesign automotive parts for repair and reproduction. 
3. **Surface modeled** different car panels and parts using referenced scanned mesh data in **Autodesk Fusion and QuickSurface**.
4. Operated and managed **3D printers** and laser cutters to produce and **refine prototypes** for various mechanical parts. 
5. Checked clearances for newly added components and structural modifications, and recommended design changes when needed.

### Bucks and Dies for Body Panel Restoration

One of my primary responsibilities was prototyping custom **dies and bucks** to improve the efficiency and accuracy of metal shaping. With multiple Lincoln restorations and mirrored driver and passenger side components, these tools helped **maintain accurate geometry, streamline fabrication, and ensure consistency across parts**. Here I display only a few of the many body panels that I have contributed into restoring. 

Work Flow:

Identify problem and solution → 3D scanning → Surface Modeling and/or CAD → 3D Printing → Final Product

### Wheel Hub Design

I had the amazing opportunity to design a **custom wheel hub** for the Lincoln based on an initial render provided by the industrial engineer that we work alongside with. The design process required careful consideration of **mechanical fitment**, including interface with the brake rotor and clearance for the brake calipers. **Multiple design iterations were explored**, evaluating wheel thickness and integrated whitewall proportions. The final concept recreated the classic whitewall aesthetic by incorporating it directly into the rim design rather than the tire itself. I 3D modeled the wheel hub in Fusion and 3D printed sections of **15 different variations** of the wheel for testing. In the future, we plan to CNC these wheels out of billet and do some post-process polishing to give it a nice shine.

### Microswitch Door Handle

I redesigned and the 1965 Lincoln Continental **door handles** for billet CNC manufacturing and converted the previous latch actuation linkage to a **hidden microswitch button**. I also added an interior reinforcement back plate to improve load distribution and prevent long-term deformation of the handle which had occured on the original handle.

### 1968 Camaro - Custom Grilles
Another project involved designing **custom lower grilles** for a classic **1968 Camaro** car model. The design required careful **integration and mounting** with the existing front body panels and **visual alignment with the upper grille**. Using Fusion, I designed both driver and passenger side grilles and tested fitment through 3D-printed prototypes. A key challenge in this project was that the pre-existing left and right openings of the front of the Camaro were not perfectly symmetric, requiring two distinct designs to achieve proper fitting.

### 1968 Camaro - Interior Center Console Covers
I also designed and prototyped custom interior covers to conceal wiring beneath the Camaro's center console. The parts were engineered to accommodate uneven carpet surfaces, secure mounting interfaces, and efficient assembly using dovetail features and relief slits. Additional offsets were incorporated to account for vinyl wrapping, ensuring a clean, seamless finished appearance.

### Air Baffles
Another complementary component to the 1968 Camaro grille redesign, I developed trunk air-relief baffles that allow trapped air to escape while preserving a cohesive aesthetic with the car. The parts feature integrated snap-fit tabs to locate and retain the baffles during installation on the driver and passenger side interior trunk panels.

### 1968 Camaro - Gasket Trim

For the same Camaro I designed the lower grilles and air baffles, I also created **custom gasket trim** for the interior door panels. The stock trim had rough edges and did not taper cleanly, so I was tasked with designing a piece that would both conceal the unfinished area and provide a smooth, finished appearance. Matching the profile to the original gasket, we produced the part using matte TPU, allowing it to flex and conform precisely into the intended slot.

### Fierro Fab Press Brake 
I was tasked with designing a custom **50" press brake** for our shop. The press brake incorporated **sheet-metal drawers** engineered to support the weight of the press brake fingers and stamping tools, providing organized storage while maintaining structural integrity under load. This has yet to be fully built but is currently in progress!
